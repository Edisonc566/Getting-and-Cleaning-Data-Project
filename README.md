# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example [this article](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/). Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

The project is about Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

This repository contains the following files:
* **README.md**, this file, which provides an overview of the data set and how it was created.
* **tidy_data.txt**, which contains the data set.
* **CodeBook.md**, describes the variables, the data, and any transformations.
* **run_analysis.R**, the R script that was used to create the data set (see the Creating the data set section below)
